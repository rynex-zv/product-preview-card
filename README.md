## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS Superstar custom properties
- chrome
- JS inline

### What I learned

-how to await in JS, and how to change attributes values. but what is resolve I have no idea, I tired passing  ``` x.setAttribute("c", "n");``` in to it and the button did not work at all!
```js
  let x = document.getElementById("submeter");
    x.onclick = async  ()=> {
      x.setAttribute("c","y");
      await resolveAfter2Seconds(10);
       x.setAttribute("c", "n");
    };
    function resolveAfter2Seconds(x) { 
        return new Promise((resolve) => {
          setTimeout(() => {
            resolve(x);
          }, 2100);
        });
      }
``` 

-SVG!! OOh SVG, the animation there is not that good, but ðŸŽ‰animationðŸŽ‰ I have spent on it over 6h to get the timing right.

-SVG: do not accept ::before and ::after on or in.

-Animation curve's it's not that difficult, but chrome divTools did help writing the CSS code. 
``` CSS
 { 
  animation: 1.5s alternate cubic-bezier(0.31, -0.06, 0.3, 0.97);
 }
```

### Continued development

-SVG needed a little more work on!
-reducing duplicated lines.
-using rem and em rather than px!
